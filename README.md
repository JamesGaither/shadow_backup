### What does this software plans to do and how is this different?
This software's overall goal is to give the user a simple, clean, fully transparent method to manage a large number of photos. Much of the software that is out there to manage photos try to be an all in one method to manage your photos and typically charge for all the features it adds. Shadow Backup aims to be different by not offering an all in one solution that replicates readily available software that does it's job exceptionally well

### What tools does Shadow Backup need to run?
Shadow Backup aims to be a piece in your arsenal of photo management tools by utilizing:
1. Your OS file sytem to manage the disk write of the photos
2. SQLite as the DataBase of choice for managing indexs of the photos for the fastest pull times for your photos
3. 7Zip(might change in the future) handles archiving and encrypting your photos for uploading to a backup server.

### What is the current state? When will this be done?
As  I am writing this in my spare time between a full time job, it will take some time before I say it is complete.  It is currently in an Alpha state with version tagged copies being those open for release if you want to work with it. I  highly suggest only people familiar with Python even try to use it at this early state, but as I build it out I would like to open it up  for  anyone to use.
I am open to suggestions, so either send me a message or drop a pull request for an added feature. Do remember, this is very much a WIP, so I have several ideas that I plan to implement in due course.
