# Shadow Backup
A WIP photo backup tool written in python3. Currently semi-operational.

### What this software plans to do
Create a backup tool that allows the user to sort through any number of photos, extract useful metadata, organize it, and package it into useful encrypted chunks of pictures ready to upload to a cloud server and/or your local backup HD.

### Why not just use XYZ backup?
I found that most backups either wanted to upload all my photos unencrypted, upload my entire hard drive, and/or was just too much money. I decided to build my own backup solution that allows me full control over my pictures without needing to upload an unencrypted picture to the Internet.

### When will this be done/can you add X to it?
I will finish when I have the time as I am writing this in my spare time. I am open to suggestions, so either send me a message or drop a pull request for an added feature. Do remember, this is very much a WIP, so I have several ideas that I plan to implement in due course.

### What does the current version do?
Currently this can create a DB, read in files to that DB and store tags
